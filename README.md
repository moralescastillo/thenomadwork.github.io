# thenomad.work

The idea is for contributors to share a place they have worked from lately. This place can be a cafe, coworking space, coliving space, airbnb apartments, booking.com accomodation, etc. Alongside the normal information, the contributor would add information regarding the place's internet speed.

This repository is a "fork" from the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) Theme. As no contributions to the original theme are expected (and to reduce complexity at the time of collaboration), no actual fork to Beautiful Jekyll was made.
